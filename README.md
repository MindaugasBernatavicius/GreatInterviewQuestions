| 1 | What is a public key finger print? What can you use if for and when? Do only public keys have fingerprints? | It is a sequence of bytes, a shortened version of the full public key for which it is the fingerprint of. The fingerprint is generated by applying a cryptographic hash function (any cryptographic function can be used for that (SHA1 or MD5), the lenght of the fingerprint desired being the primary factor for choosing (md5 produces a 128 bit fingerprint, sha1 - 160 bit) ) to the initial public key. The primary uses include (i) simplified key management; (ii) identification of the public key; (iii) |
| 2 | You are working for a company that uses RAID10 NAS for its database server w/ 4 HDDs of 1TB. Name the reasons you would recommend a backup solution for them and not recommend it. | The main reasons are (i) malware suceptability, (ii) intrusion possibility (all drives in the RAID are succeptable to the same malware and intrusions with backups being offline), single-location dangers (very miniscule considering todays datacenters). |
